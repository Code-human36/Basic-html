<h1>Most Good looking Anime Characters</h1>
<p>One of anime’s highlights has to be all the good looking guys. Many anime contain at least one male character so handsome that we all end up swooning. And that’s why we’ll be talking about the 15 best anime with good looking guys.</p>

<p>For this list, we’ll be considering those anime which have an ensemble cast of good looking guys, and not just one incredibly hot guy in an otherwise average or female-populated cast.</p>

<p>So, even though Usui comes to mind when thinking about handsome anime boys, Maid Sama! won’t appear in this list. And we must also add that the entries on this list are placed in no specific order.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, let’s begin the list of the 15 best anime with good looking guys.</p>

    <p>BL anime often gets a stereotype attached to it which Given breaks wonderfully with its powerful and emotional story. It’s a story about Mafuyu, a teenager dealing with the suicide of his boyfriend, and his journey of love and healing through music.</p>

    <p>Mainstream action anime contain a huge number of characters, many of whom are good looking. But the number of such anime are so many that we’ve excluded them from the list.</p>
    <p>Jujutsu Kaisen, however, snatches this spot with drop-dead gorgeous characters Gojo, Sukuna, Geto, Nanami and many more. With an amazing story and brilliant action, this is one of the best anime with good looking guys.</p>
